      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        At <strong>Code & Bites</strong>, we merge two worlds we love: technology and good food. We were born from the dream of creating a place where programmers, gamers, cinephiles, and geeks from all galaxies can gather, share, and enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our restaurant is inspired by the geek universe: from the names of the dishes to the thematic decoration with retro consoles, action figures, and private rooms for role-playing sessions or series marathons.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are more than just a restaurant. We are a community where every bug has a solution and every dish comes with its own easter egg. Come to Code & Bites, the only place where you can debug code while dining on a Chewburrito or a Pok√©pizza!
